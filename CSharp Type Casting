//Type Casting is when you asign a calue of one data type to another type.  The two types are:

//Implicit Casting(Automatically) converting a smaller type to a larger type size
//char -> int -> long -> float -> double

//Explicit Casting(Manually) converting a larger type to a smaller size type
//double -> float -> long -> int -> char

int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt; //Automatic casting: int to double

Console.WriteLine(myInt);
Console.WriteLine(myDouble);
